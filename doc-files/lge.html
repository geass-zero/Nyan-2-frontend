    <p>Welcome to NYAN.finance, the first DeFi Hedgefund. <br />Lets build a whale together!</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>What is Nyan.finance?</h2>
    <p>Nyan.finance is a community driven, decentralized, hedgefunding project.<br />Participants can create investment proposals that benefits all holders, cast their vote on other proposals to get it to pass, or put up a governance vote for steering the project's mid- to long-term vision and execution plan.<br /><br /></p>
    <h2>What is an LGE and why is Nyan.finance having one?</h2>
    Nyan.finance is currently transitioning from the V1 tokenomics to a more robust, flexible and improved V2 system. In order to make sure the V2 hedgefund has enough liquidity to start operating from the start with accceptable yielding, a proposal to organize a Liquid Generation Event has been put up for voting, and passed with 3204votes.&nbsp;</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>The Liquid Generation Event aims to gather enough liquidity in 4 days to guarantee a smooth V1 to V2 swap, right after the closing.&nbsp;<br /><br />Current (and new) holders of the NYAN v1 token are being encouraged to take part in the LGE by receiving benefits listed below:</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <ul>
    <li>LGE participants will be joining the pool early and at a reduced cost of .1ETH per NYAN staked</li>
    <li>LGE participants will also receive a mining boost in the form of an NFT, after the LGE concludes. The details for this NFT are as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>0-3 ETH: no mining boost</li>
    <li>3-6 ETH: 5% mining boost</li>
    <li>6-18 ETH: 7.5% mining boost</li>
    <li>18-36 ETH: 12.5% mining boost</li>
    <li>36+ ETH: 20% mining boost</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
